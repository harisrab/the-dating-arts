							He has acquired a massive amount of knowledge in a
							well rounded range of areas and topics and can go as
							deep as you would like with virtually all topics
							with regards to social interactions, dating and
							relationships. With a focus on confidence building,
							leadership, image & style, conversation skills,
							reconnecting with fun, being legitimately cool,
							Colgate focuses on his clients individual
							personality types, drive, and ambition and quickly
							recognizes the key underlying factors that can lead
							to an imbalance between personal, dating and social
							happiness and abundance. While the focus of his
							coaching is on making his clients empirically
							better, the lessons learned translate very easily
							into their personal and professional lives. Colgate
							prides himself on his track record and dedication to
							making sure all of his clients reach a level that is
							truly far beyond their expectation in a clear,
							logical, unbiased, and sustainable approach with a
							system and practical execution for success.
